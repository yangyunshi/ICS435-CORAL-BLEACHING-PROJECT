# Coral Bleaching Classification with Machine Learning

This project is focused on classifying coral images as **healthy** or **bleached** based on color data. The model uses different machine learning algorithms including **SVM**, **KNN**, **Logistic Regression**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest** for binary classification (CORAL vs CORAL_BL). The data consists of multiple columns representing color values in hexadecimal format, which are converted to RGB for model input. Our goal is to develop accurate, efficient, and accessible models that can assist in large-scale coral reef monitoring, particularly in resource-constrained field conditions.

## Model Performance (Test Set)

| Model                  | Accuracy | AUC   | Pros                                  | Cons                                |
|------------------------|----------|-------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| CNN (Convolutional)    | ~0.85    | N/A   | High accuracy, captures spatial data  | Requires GPU, high storage/compute  |
| KNN + Color Extraction | ~0.82    | ~0.89 | Lightweight, interpretable, fast      | May miss texture/structural cues    |
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.8185   | ~0.89 | Strong generalization, interpretable  | Requires manual feature extraction  |

## Results

After training and evaluating the models, the following results were obtained:
The script evaluates the models using the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**
2. **Precision**
3. **Recall**
4. **F1-score**
- **AUC**: AUC scores are plotted to demonstrate how well the models distinguish between the two classes.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Confusion matrices for each model were plotted to visualize the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.


## Summary

This repository contains two key files:

1. **`get_coral_color_data.py`**: A Python script that processes images of coral to extract their color data. The script converts hexadecimal color values from the images into RGB values and generates a dataset containing color information, which will later be used for training machine learning models. It is the first step in preparing data for analysis.

2. **`coral_bleaching_models.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that implements machine learning models to predict coral bleaching (or coral and coral-like conditions). It uses the dataset generated by the `get_coral_color_data.py` script and applies multiple machine learning models like SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify the coral conditions based on the color data.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Run `get_coral_color_data.py`

This script extracts color information from coral images and prepares the dataset for training.

1. **Download the Images**: Place the coral images that you want to analyze in a folder (ensure that the images are in a format like PNG, JPEG, etc.).

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `get_coral_color_data.py`.
   - Execute the script by running the following command:
     ```bash
     python get_coral_color_data.py --image_folder <path_to_image_folder> --output_file <output_csv_file>
     ```
     - Replace `<path_to_image_folder>` with the path to the folder containing the coral images.
     - Replace `<output_csv_file>` with the name of the output CSV file (e.g., `coral_colors.csv`).

   - The script will extract the color information from the images, convert the hex values to RGB, and output a CSV file with the dataset.

3. **Review the Output**:
   - The script will generate a CSV file containing the color data. This file can be used in the next step for training the machine learning models.

### Step 2: Run `coral_bleaching_models.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook uses the dataset generated in Step 1 to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting coral bleaching based on color data.

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Ensure that the CSV file generated by `get_coral_color_data.py` is available. It will be used as input for the notebook.

2. **Open the Notebook**:
   - Open the `coral_bleaching_models.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

3. **Load the Data**:
   - The notebook will load the dataset (generated in Step 1) and preprocess it, including converting color columns to RGB format.

4. **Train the Models**:
   - The notebook applies multiple machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to predict coral bleaching based on the color data.
   - It performs hyperparameter tuning via grid search to identify the best performing model and evaluates the models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

5. **Results and Evaluation**:
   - After training, the notebook will output performance metrics for each model, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
   - ROC curves for each model will be plotted to visualize performance.
   
6. **Make Predictions**:
   - After the models are trained, you can use them to make predictions on new data
